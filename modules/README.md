# Modules

Modules are intended to help you focus on acquiring a
specific set of skills. Each Module starts with a list of
specific skills and then provides resources, search terms and exercises to help
you acquire those skills.

As you go through a Module stay focused on learning the
specific skills listed at the top.

Modules aim to support you in figuring out how to research,
learn about and practice a specific set of skills. __Modules are NOT designed to
teach you the skills.__ Modules are meant to help you develop the meta-learning
skills that will enable you to use the Internet to research, learn and practice
the skills you need on your own.

An invaluable meta-skill required to become a successful software developer is
the ability to learn new skills on demand.

You won't stop learning after you leave the guild and begin your career. A daily
part of your job as a web developer will be researching and learning new skills.

So remember, while you're learning these skills you're also learning how to
teach yourself these kinds of skills in the future. Do your own google searches,
learn to how find the answers you need, get the skills you need and move on.
