# Environment Variable

## Definition

Environment variables store information about your current Shell or environment that you're working in. They're used to answer questions like `What is my current working directory?` `echo $PWD`, or `What is the current user name?` `echo $USER`. When you start managing a web app, you'll use environment variables to store private variables you don't want displayed in your code for the whole world to see.
