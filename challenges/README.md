# Challenges

Challenges are intended to be used as a tool to test yourself for the
skills the previous practice modules aimed to help you learn.

Challenges and will require you to use
[problem decomposition skills](./Problem-Decomposition/README.md). A working
solution to these modules will require solving multiple problems in a series of
steps.
